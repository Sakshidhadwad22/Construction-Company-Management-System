# Construction-Company-Management-System
ABSTRACT: Construction is the process of constructing a building or
infrastructure. Construction differs from manufacturing. Manufacturing
typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated
purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known
client. Construction is directly tied to the fields of civil engineering and
architecture. A construction company is responsible for building structures in
the commercial and private sectors. In simple words, we can say that a
construction company is a type of business, enterprise, or similar organization
created and operating to construct a wide variety of buildings, developments,
housing, path, pavement, roads, motorways, and other types of construction
projects. A construction company involves lot of parameters like details of
projects, employees, machineries and raw materials. A good management
system will reduce the tedious work of managing various factors in a
